In GitHub Actions, you can use the npx command just like you would in any other environment. npx is a package runner tool that comes with npm (Node Package Manager), and it allows you to execute binaries from npm packages.

Here's an example of how you might use npx in a GitHub Actions workflow:

yaml
Copy code
name: Node.js CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [14]

    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        npm install

      # Execute the update of the browser instance of npm
      - name: Update browser list
        run: npx update-browserslist-db@latest

      - name: Maven Deploy
        run: mvn -X -B deploy --file pom.xml
        env:
          secret_BINTRAY_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.BINTRAY_USERNAME }}
          secret_BINTRAY_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.BINTRAY_PASSWORD }}
